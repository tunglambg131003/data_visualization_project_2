## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been one of the most impactful global health crises in modern history, fundamentally altering societies, economies, and public health systems. Since its emergence in late 2019, COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe, leading to millions of infections and deaths. Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of its transmission is crucial for effective public health responses, particularly in densely populated urban areas like New York City (NYC), where variations in population density, socioeconomic status, and healthcare infrastructure exacerbate the spread of the virus. Visualizing the spread of COVID-19 provides vital insights into these dynamics, revealing patterns of infection, hospitalization, mortality, and recovery that are essential for targeted interventions. Interactive dashboards and data visualizations enable real-time analysis of pandemic trends, helping policymakers, public health officials, and the general public to track the evolution of the disease and assess the impact of public health measures such as lockdowns, vaccination rollouts, and testing strategies. This project leverages data from both local NYC sources and global datasets to create an interactive Shiny application that visualizes the spatiotemporal progression of COVID-19, providing a comparative analysis between local and global trends. By focusing on NYC, a city with diverse demographic characteristics and a complex healthcare system, this project aims to uncover disparities in pandemic outcomes and contribute to more informed decision-making, ultimately promoting more equitable and effective public health interventions.
