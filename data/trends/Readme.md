# trends/ 

This folder contains files with daily, weekly, and monthly data shown across time. Note that these trend data are published by date of event, not by date of report. The Health Department recommends against interpreting daily changes to these files as one dayâ€™s worth of data, due to the difference between date of event and date of report.

## Files 

### caserate-by-modzcta.csv 

This file contains the rate of cases per 100,000 people, stratified by week and three different geographies: citywide, borough, and modified ZIP Code Tabulation Area (MODZCTA). The level of geography is indicated following the underscore (_) in each column heading. Please see the technical notes for a [description of MODZCTA](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#geography-zip-codes-and-zctas).

People with COVID-19 are categorized based on the date of diagnosis, and are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Monday, October 12, 2020 would be categorized as diagnosed during the week ending October 17, 2020. Note that sum of counts in this file may not match values in citywide tables because of records with missing geographic information.

The rate of cases per 100,000 people is suppressed for a specific geography when the count of deaths is greater than 0 and less than 5 due to imprecise and unreliable estimates and also to protect patient confidentiality. 

Note that sum of counts in this file may not match values in citywide tables because of:
* Records with missing geographic information
* Cells that are suppressed due to imprecise and unreliable estimates or for the protection of patient confidentiality

### cases-by-day.csv  

This file contains citywide and borough-specific daily counts of probable and confirmed cases. Cases are aggregated by the date of diagnosis. To address variation in the number of cases diagnosed per day, we have included a 7-day average (mean). This is calculated as the average of number of cases on that day and the previous 6 days.

This file includes data since February 29, 2020 based on the date that the Health Department classifies as the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC (i.e., date of the first laboratory-confirmed case).

People with COVID-19 are categorized based on the date of diagnosis, and are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Monday, June 21, 2021 would be categorized as diagnosed during the week ending June 26, 2021. Rates are suppressed if the count of the numerator is between 1 and 4, to prevent the display of unreliable rates.

Data on people identified as American Indian/Alaska Native, two or more races, or certain other races/ethnicities not listed are not included in this table. The Hispanic/Latino category includes people of any race. Race/ethnicity information is most complete for people who have been hospitalized or have died. There are much less data currently available on race/ethnicity for people who have not been hospitalized.

Differences in health outcomes among racial and ethnic groups are due to long-term institutional and personal biases against people of color. There is no evidence that these health inequities are due to personal traits. Lasting racism and an inequitable distribution of resources needed for wellness cause these health inequities. These resources include quality jobs, housing, health care and food, among others. The greater impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people of color shows how these inequities influence health outcomes.

The greater impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people of color shows how these inequities influence health outcomes.

### weekly-hosp-rate-age.csv 

This file contains the rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 people, stratified by week and age group. 

People with COVID-19 are categorized based on the date of admission, and are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person who was admitted to the hospital on Monday, June 21, 2021 would be categorized as hospitalized during the week ending June 26, 2021. Rates are suppressed if the count of the numerator is between 1 and 4, to prevent the display of unreliable rates.

Indicators include: 

| Variable name | Definition | Timeframe |

| AGE_75UP | Rate of hospitalized cases per 100,000 among people aged 75+ years | Full week preceding the week-ending date | 

The rate of hospitalized cases per 100,000 people is suppressed for a specific age group when the count of hospitalized deaths is between 1 and 4 due to imprecise and unreliable estimates.

### weekly-hosp-rate-race.csv 

This file contains the rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 people, stratified by week and race/ethnicity group. Rates are age-adjusted according to [the US 2000 standard population](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt20.pdf).

People with COVID-19 are categorized based on the date of admission, and are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person who was admitted to the hospital on Monday, June 21, 2021 would be categorized as hospitalized during the week ending June 26, 2021. Rates are suppressed if the count of the numerator is between 1 and 4, to prevent the display of unreliable rates.

Indicators include: 

| Variable name | Definition | Timeframe |  
| --------------|------------|-----------| 
| WEEK_ENDING | Week-ending date | | 
| ALL_RACE_ETHNICITY | Rate of hospitalized cases per 100,000 among people of all race/ethnicity groups | Full week preceding the week-ending date | 
| ASIAN_PACIFIC_ISLANDER | Rate of hospitalized cases per 100,000 among people reported as Asian or Pacific Islander | Full week preceding the week-ending date | 
| BLACK_AFRICAN_AMERICAN | Rate of hospitalized cases per 100,000 among people reported as Black or African-American | Full week preceding the week-ending date | 
| HISPANIC_LATINO | Rate of hospitalized cases per 100,000 among people reported as Hispanic/Latino | Full week preceding the week-ending date | 
| WHITE | Rate of hospitalized cases per 100,000 among people reported as White | Full week preceding the week-ending date | 

The rate of hospitalized cases per 100,000 people is suppressed for a specific race/ethnicity group when the count of hospitalized deaths is between 1 and 4 due to imprecise and unreliable estimates.

Data on people identified as American Indian/Alaska Native, two or more races, or certain other races/ethnicities not listed are not included in this table. The Hispanic/Latino category includes people of any race. Race/ethnicity information is most complete for people who have been hospitalized or have died. There are much less data currently available on race/ethnicity for people who have not been hospitalized.

Note that sum of counts in this file may not match citywide values because of records with missing demographic information.

Differences in health outcomes among racial and ethnic groups are due to long-term institutional and personal biases against people of color. There is no evidence that these health inequities are due to personal traits. Lasting racism and an inequitable distribution of resources needed for wellness cause these health inequities. These resources include quality jobs, housing, health care and food, among others. The greater impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people of color shows how these inequities influence health outcomes.
