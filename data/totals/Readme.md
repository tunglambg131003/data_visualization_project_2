# totals/ 

This folder contains cumulative totals since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC, which the Health Department defines as the diagnosis of the first confirmed COVID-19 case on February 29, 2020. The Health Department recommends against interpreting daily changes to these files as one day’s worth of data, due to the difference between date of event and date of report.

## Files 

### by-group.csv

This file contains counts and rates of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, stratified by age, sex, borough, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood poverty (low, medium, high, very high). Methods for determining neighborhood poverty are outlined in the technical notes ([Poverty Groups](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#poverty-groups)). 

Rates are:   
- Cumulative since the start of the outbreak   
- Per 100,000 people by specified group   
- Age-adjusted according to [the US 2000 standard population](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt20.pdf) for race/ethnicity and neighborhood poverty groups 

Indicators include: 

| Variable name | Definition | Timeframe | 
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------| 
| group |Population group category | | 
| subgroup | Population subgroup: age group in years, sex, borough of residence, race/ethnicity, or neighborhood poverty group| | 
| CONFIRMED_CASE_RATE | Rate of confirmed cases per 100,000 people by age group | Cumulative | 
| CASE_RATE | Rate of confirmed and probable cases per 100,000 people by age group | Cumulative | 
| HOSPITALIZED_RATE | Rate of hospitalized confirmed and probable cases per 100,000 people by age group | Cumulative | 
| DEATH_RATE | Rate of total deaths per 100,000 people by age group | Cumulative | 
| CONFIRMED_CASE_COUNT | Number of confirmed cases by age group | Cumulative | 
| PROBABLE_CASE_COUNT | Number of probable cases by age group | Cumulative | 
| CASE_COUNT | Number of confirmed and probable cases by age group | Cumulative | 
| HOSPITALIZED_COUNT | Number of hospitalized confirmed and probable cases by age group | Cumulative | 
| DEATH_COUNT | Number of total deaths by age group | Cumulative | 

Note that sum of counts in this file may not match citywide values because of records with missing demographic information. 

Demograhic information is based on what is reported to the Health Department by laboratories. 

Due to the small number of cases reported among transgender and gender-nonconforming people, data on these cases are not included in this table at this time. Data on people identified as American Indian/Alaska Native, two or more races, or other races/ethnicities are not included in this table. The Hispanic/Latino category includes people of any race. Race/ethnicity information is most complete for people who have been hospitalized or have died. There are much less data currently available on race/ethnicity for people who have not been hospitalized.    

Differences in health outcomes among racial and ethnic groups are due to long-term institutional and personal biases against people of color. There is no evidence that these health inequities are due to personal traits. Lasting racism and an inequitable distribution of resources needed for wellness cause these health inequities. These resources include quality jobs, housing, health care and food, among others. The greater impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people of color shows how these inequities influence health outcomes.

Note: this file replaces by-age.csv, by-boro.csv, by-poverty.csv, by-race.csv, and by-sex.csv. Those files are no longer being updated.

### summary.csv   

This file contains cumulative summary information, including the cut-off date and time for data included in the most recent update, and several citywide indicators.  

Hospitalization counts reflect the total number of people with COVID-19 ever admitted to a hospital, not the number of people currently admitted. Case and death counts reflect totals, separately.
