## Key Correlations

### Testing vs Other Variables
- **Testing vs GDP per capita**: +0.426 (moderate positive correlation)
- **Testing vs COVID cases per 100k**: +0.576 (strong positive correlation)
- **Testing vs COVID deaths per 100k**: +0.277 (weak positive correlation)

## Key Insights

### 1. Economic Development and Testing Capacity
- **Strong relationship**: Wealthier countries generally conducted more tests per capita
- **Europe and Eastern Mediterranean** lead in testing rates
- **Africa** has the lowest average testing rates, correlating with lower GDP

### 2. Testing and Case Detection
- **Strong positive correlation (0.576)** between testing rates and reported cases per 100k
- This suggests that higher testing leads to better case detection
- Countries with limited testing may have significant underreporting

### 3. Regional Disparities
- **Massive testing inequality**: Austria tested 1,950x more per capita than DRC
- **Resource constraints**: Poorest countries had the least testing capacity
- **Public health infrastructure**: Correlates strongly with economic development

### 4. Testing and Outcomes
- **Moderate correlation** between testing and deaths per 100k
- Higher testing countries may have detected more cases but also had better healthcare systems
- Early detection through testing may have improved treatment outcomes

## Country Name Mapping Handled

The script successfully handled numerous country name differences, including:
- "United States" → "United States of America"
- "South Korea" → "Republic of Korea"
- "Czechia" → "Czechia" (direct match)
- "Democratic Republic of Congo" → "Democratic Republic of the Congo"
- "Kosovo" → "Kosovo (in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1244 (1999))"

## Data Quality Notes

### Missing Testing Data
132 countries lack testing data, including major countries like:
- China, Russia, Brazil, Turkey
- Many African and Asian countries
- Small island nations and territories

### Data Limitations
- Testing data represents cumulative totals through mid-2022
- Different countries may have different testing methodologies
- Some countries may count tests differently (people vs. samples)
- Reporting standards vary significantly

## Files Generated

1. **`covid_gdp_testing_merged.csv`** - Complete merged dataset with testing data
2. **`merge_testing_data.R`** - Script for merging testing data
3. **`Testing_Data_Merge_Summary.md`** - This summary document

## Usage for Analysis

This enhanced dataset now enables analysis of:
- **Testing strategies** and their effectiveness
- **Relationship between economic capacity and testing**
- **Impact of testing on case detection and outcomes**
- **Regional disparities** in pandemic response capabilities
- **Public health infrastructure** assessment

## Next Steps

Potential analyses with this enhanced dataset:
1. **Testing efficiency**: Cases detected per test
2. **Economic analysis**: Cost-effectiveness of testing strategies
3. **Temporal analysis**: Testing rates over time (if time-series data available)
4. **Policy impact**: Correlation between testing policies and outcomes
5. **Equity analysis**: Testing access across different economic levels

## Technical Notes

### Merge Success Rate
- **44% of countries** successfully matched with testing data
- **Country name mapping** handled 58 different naming variations
- **Data integrity** maintained throughout the merge process

### Column Structure
The testing data (`Tests_per_1000_people`) was inserted after GDP data for logical flow:
1. Country identification
2. WHO Region
3. GDP per capita 2022
4. **Tests per 1000 people** (NEW)
5. COVID cases and deaths data

This comprehensive dataset now provides a robust foundation for analyzing the relationship between economic development, testing capacity, and COVID-19 outcomes across countries.
